				<p>Dune is a 2021 American epic-science fiction film directed by Denis Villeneuve with a screenplay by Jon Spaihts, Villeneuve, and Eric Roth. It is the first of a planned two-part adaptation of the 1965 novel of the same name by Frank Herbert, primarily covering the first half of the book. Set in the far future, it follows Paul Atreides, as he and his family, the noble House Atreides, are thrust into a war for the dangerous desert planet Arrakis, between the native Fremen people and the enemy invaders, the House Harkonnen. <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_(2021_film)' target='blank' title='Source'>Source</a></p>

				<p>Following a failed attempt by Paramount Pictures to reboot the 1984 film adaptation, Legendary Entertainment acquired film and TV rights to the science fiction novel Dune in 2016. Development began shortly after, with Villeneuve expressing interest in the project and officially signing on as director in January 2017. He worked with Roth and Spaihts to write the screenplay, breaking it into two parts and incorporating an updated 21st century adaptation of the 1965 novel. Filming took place from March to July 2019 at various locations including areas in Budapest, Jordan, Norway, and Abu Dhabi. <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_(2021_film)' target='blank' title='Source'>Source</a></p>
